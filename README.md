This is a Visual Studio project (.sln) and the language used is C#. Application uses sockets (client and server) to establish connections. AES encryption is used to store all the usernames and passswords.
Chat information that flows through the stream on the network is also AES encrypted. As it is privacy focused so I have tried to encrypt everything with the latest and most powerfull encryption.
Note: You can change and use the code however you like :)
